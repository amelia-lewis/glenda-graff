excerpt: Thank you does not seem enough, for all you have done in the past year leading up to Melissa and Jonathan's wedding - as well as making the MOST beautiful wedding imaginable!<br />Your tireless devotion, energy and attention to detail is indescribable. Even with the children living overseas during planning stages, you worked our time by day and France time by night! Nothing was ever too much trouble for you. From beginning to end, you have stood by our sides - assembling invitations, choosing make-up artists, wrapping personalised gifts, double checking guest lists, making sure each person left home on time, to waving the bride and groom goodbye at the end of the night! Melissa was certainly sad when the night was over, as were we. But, our memories will live forever, thanks to you!<br />We have had numerous calls and letters telling us how magnificent the wedding was, but actually, they should all have been addressed to you - without you, we could not have had the wedding we had!
