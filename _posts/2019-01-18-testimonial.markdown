excerpt: I have retained the services of Glenda Graff as the event coordinator for numerous family functions including my daughter's wedding in the Hunter Valley. On every occasion she has managed to put together an amazing event with professionalism and attention to detail with a definite "wow factor". All the functions have gone off without a hitch and we were able to relax and enjoy ourselves and leave everything up to Glenda and her amazing team.
